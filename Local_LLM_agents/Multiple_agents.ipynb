      "Based on my observations, here's how the company can build a product or service on Generative AI in financial services with sustainable growth and profit:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Fraud Detection and Prevention: Implement GANs that can identify suspicious transactions and patterns. The discriminator part of the GAN can be trained to differentiate between normal and fraudulent transactions, while the generator can be used to create synthetic transactions for training the model.\n",

      "\n",
      "5. Support for Finance Function Business Partners: Generative AI assistants can be developed to provide insights into financial forecasts, scenario planning, and decision-making. These assistants can be trained on a wide range of financial data and scenarios, and can generate insights and recommendations based on this training.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Data Security: Given the sensitive nature of financial data, robust security measures need to be in place. The company needs to make sure that the Generative AI models are secure and that the data used for training these models is properly protected.\n",
